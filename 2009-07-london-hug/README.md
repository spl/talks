**Title:**      Fun and generic things to do with EMGM

**Date:**       2009-07-09

**Location:**   City University in London, UK

**Audience:**   London Haskell Users Group

**Abstract:**
Generic programming has become a popular technique for reducing code and
simplifying programs. There are many libraries for Haskell programmers that
offer different approaches to generic programming. This talk introduces one such
library, [Extensible and Modular Generics for the
Masses](http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/GenericProgramming/EMGM) (EMGM), that was
uploaded to Hackage for the first time in September 2008. EMGM uses type classes
to provide a sum-of-products representation of datatypes. Not quite as
well-known as its cousin, Scrap Your Boilerplate, EMGM also provides a wealth of
generic functions. Additionally, EMGM allows programmers to easily write their
own generic functions and specialize any function for arbitrary datatypes. In
this talk, we look at the building blocks of EMGM, at various generic functions
provided by the library, how do define one's own generic function, and at some
potential uses.
