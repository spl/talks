**Title:**      Dissecting Flavors of GP in Haskell

**Date:**       2013-08-27

**Location:**   [Galois](http://corp.galois.com/) in Portland, Oregon, USA

**Audience:**   Galois employees

**Abstract:**
The goals of this talk are (1) to introduce datatype-generic programming in
Haskell using a simplified version of the ``Generic Deriving'' library and (2)
to demonstrate how this particular library can be adapted to support multiple
flavors (or views) of datatype-generic programming. We start by describing the
basic sums-of-products flavor as a foundation and end with presentations of a
Uniplate function (demonstrating the Uniplate flavor) and a fold (demonstrating
the fixed-point view). Type eqality using overlapping instances plays a key part
in extending the initial library to support other flavors.
