**Location:**   House4Hack in Centurion, South Africa

**Audience:**   Lambda Luminaries

**Abstract:**
This talk has two parts. The first part introduces the concepts of
datatype-generic programming from the basics of datatypes and their structure.
The description should be accessible by anyone familiar with Haskell. The second
part describes another application of generics and type system features of
Haskell to solve the "printf" problem.
